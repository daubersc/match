        My love for you is like the raging sea,
        \nSo powerful and deep it will forever be.
        \nThrough storm, wind, and heavy rain,
        \nIt will withstand every pain.
        \n
        \nThis year I\'m going to gift you this application. Hopefully it will bring you more joy
        than pain. You are the love of my life, Peter and I truly love you.  The computer\'s logic
        is based on my own, so in a way you always play against me.
